* Emacs Xwidget Apps

Emacs can leverage xwidget to display web content in buffers.
This repo contains some Emacs apps that display themselves via xwidget.

The project is in early alpha and the only available app is org-mind-map-live which shows the org headers as mindmaps.

** How to use

1. Get and evaluate the `xwidget-apps.el` file;
2. Enable the `xwidget-apps-mode`. An xwidget buffer should appear automatically, where the mind map app is presented.
3. Split the window and open an org file, the mind map will be updated on the fly.
