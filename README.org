* org-mindmap-live

The project is in early alpha.

## How to use

Evaluate the `org-mindmap-live.el` file and open http://localhost:12301 with `xwidget-webkit-browse-url`.
Of course you can also use your own browser.

Note that the mind map only changes if the current Emacs buffer is in the org major-mode.
